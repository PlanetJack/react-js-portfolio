Later, I utilized React to develop a Tech Website and personal portfolio projects, gaining experience in applying component-based architecture and state management. \n\nI focused on creating user-friendly UI and implementing responsive designs, which significantly enhanced my practical web development skills.",

                "description": "Building on my academic foundation and practical experience, I have developed proficiency in back-end technologies. During my time as a Robotics Developer, I worked on integrating robotic systems with in-house software using C#. \n\nI handled data communication between robots and our system and used Redis to store and retrieve robot data, improving system performance through caching. \n\nIn my academic projects, I worked with Java, MySQL, and OracleDB, which helped me understand database design, SQL queries, and backend logic. Recently, I expanded my skills by learning Node.js and exploring MongoDB to build RESTful APIs and lightweight back-end services. By combining these technologies, I have a strong grasp of developing scalable and maintainable server-side systems, with an emphasis on efficient data management and integration with front-end applications.
