During my time as a Robotics Developer, I worked on integrating robotic systems with in-house software using C#. \n\nI handled data communication between robots and our system and used Redis to store and retrieve robot data, improving system performance through caching. \n\nIn my academic projects, I worked with Java, MySQL, and OracleDB, which helped me understand database design, SQL queries, and backend logic. Recently, I expanded my skills by learning Node.js and exploring MongoDB to build RESTful APIs and lightweight back-end services. By combining these technologies, I have a strong grasp of developing scalable and maintainable server-side systems, with an emphasis on efficient data management and integration with front-end applications.
