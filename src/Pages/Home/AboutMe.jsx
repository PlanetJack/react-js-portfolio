                    I am a creative problem solver,
                    always approaching challenges with a positive mindset.
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description">
                    My proactive attitude helps me foster a collaborative and
                    constructive environment within the team, even in the face of difficulties.
                    Although I tend to be cautious initially, I quickly adapt to new surroundings,
                    improving communication and cooperation as I grow more comfortable with my teammates.
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description">
                    I am open to various perspectives, always seeking the best solutions
                    while maintaining mutual respect and understanding during discussions or disagreements.
                    With an ENFJ personality type, I naturally gravitate toward leadership and teamwork,
                    contributing positively to the organization by encouraging
                    active communication and considering different viewpoints.
